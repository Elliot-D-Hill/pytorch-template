Docstrings are better for mature projects when functions won't change often. The issue is that as the code of a function changes the documentation may begin to not reflect the actual behavior of the function (this is called documentation drift). The compiler or your tests will complain at you if your code has a bug, but no error will be raised if your documentation doesn't match the function behavior.\n",

Simple code is easier to read, write, modify, and, validate than clever code, therefore prefer simple code. That being said, sometimes clever code is also simpler, so it often comes down to a judgment call."
